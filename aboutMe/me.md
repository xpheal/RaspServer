## Summary
I'm currently an undergraduate senior majoring Computer Science in University of Wisconsin-Madison. It's been approximately two years since I came to the States and it's about time I start doing something in life. I'm planning to work on personal projects from time to time and publish them on this website. This website will become something like a journal for me to keep track of what I'm doing.

I plan to work on projects related to Artificial Intelligence and Data Science because that's where my interest lies. My first two goals are writing a simple Voice Recognition program and a Web Crawler.
